Computer vision is a subset of artificial intelligence and a common used field in the modern world. 
Basically computer vision is how the computers can see and understand the physical world by using visual inputs devices such as cameras.
It is similar to how we can see the world by using eyes and understand the visual inputs by using our brain.
In this project, we are using YOLO package.

What is YOLO?
YOLO is a advanced algorithm that was created for the purpose of object detection.
It was created by a group of computer scientists led by Joseph Redmon at university of Washington.
The main reason that makes YOLO aparts from other object detection algorithms is its ability to process an entire image just through a single pass. 
YOLO is commonly used in major aplication types such as sel-driving cars, image and video analysing tools, security systems etc. 
YOLO is a part of ultralytics library in python.

what is openCV :
opencv is a common python package that is used to create the computer vision.
OpenCV is short for open-source computer vision library.It is an open-source maching learning software library that was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.
