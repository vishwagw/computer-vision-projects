# Introduction
Road and line detection is an essential task for a self-driving car. 
The process is done using computer vision, one of the subfields of AI.
I am creating this python model Using Machine Learning algorithms.

This model is initially for a self driving car but I have modified it to apply to an autonomous drone.
Camera angle, distance is different when comparing self driving car and autonomous drone.
the model can detect and track lines in real time using computer vision and image processing. 

There are two python scripts in the model.
1. detect.py - main program
2. GUI.py - graphical user interface

# libraries
1. matplotlib - image , pyplot
2. numpy
3. moviepy
4. cv2
5. math
6. os

# Hough trabsform space

The hough transform space is a technique which can be used to isolate features of a particular shape within an image. 
Because it requires that te desired features be specified in some parametric form, the classical Hough transform is most commonly used for the detection of regular curve as lines, circle, ellipses. 
The complexity of generalized Hough algorithm is high.
The Hough technique is particularly useful for computing a global description of a feature(s).
